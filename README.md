> ***VERY IMPORTANT***: When installing Node.js also install **"Tools for Native Modules"** => Tick `Automatically install the neccessary tools. Note that this will also install Chocolatey. The script will pop-up in a new window after the installation completes.`
>
> First run the `install.bat` file to install all necessary packages and `setup.bat` ask for your webhook and `build.bat` to compile exe.
>
> At end of building, `build.bat` will ask you for the icon you would like to have on your executable. 
> ``The filetype must be ".ico" and the icon should be 16x16px, 32x32px, 64x64px, 128x128px, 256x256px``
